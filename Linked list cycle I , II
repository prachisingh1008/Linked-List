LINKED LIST CYCLE I-

class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        if(head==NULL || head->next==NULL)
        {
            return false;
        }
       ListNode *slow=head;
        ListNode *fast=head->next;
        while(slow!=fast)
        {
            if(fast==NULL||fast->next==NULL)
            {
                return false;
            }
         slow=slow->next;
            fast=fast->next->next;
        }
        return true;

         
    }
};

Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

class Solution {

       ListNode*entry=head;
       while(fast!=NULL&&fast->next!=NULL&&fast->next->next!=NULL)
       {
         
           slow=slow->next;
           fast=fast->next->next;
       
       if(slow==fast)
       {
           while(entry!=slow)
           {
               slow=slow->next;
               entry=entry->next;
           }
       
       return slow;}
       }
       return NULL;
    }
};

Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to (0-indexed). It is -1 if there is no cycle. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Do not modify the linked list.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
